					<h4>Brianna Odell</h4>
						<p>Brianna Odell is a sophomore at Bayside High School, that 
						is infatuated with fashion. She strives to be a successful model 
						as she gets older. Her hidden talent, that she does not tell people, 
						is writing poetry. Her poetry is beautiful and she discovered and 
						never told anyone at age 12. She loves computers as she is dedicated 
						to work with computers, as a side job. Brianna is as well a kind-hearted 
						person, who succeeds if determined to focus. Math and Science are subjects 
						she finds trouble in, but her good subjects are English, Computer, and Social 
						Studies. Through her future, she finds it beneficial and the best choice to continue 
						working with computers and build up her modeling career.</p>
					<h4>Justin Wang</h4>
						<p> My name is Justin Wang and I have always desired to enter the Computer Science 
						engineering field. I have only just recently started to learn about computer programming 
						and I know that I still have much to learn. However, my main focus is to improve and learn 
						as much as possible whether it be the simple or complex. I will pay close attention to 
						anything that is placed in front of me and I am willing to work with anyone despite our 
						differences in opinion. I will keep an open mind and a clear head only focusing on the task
						at hand.
						<br>
						I have always found an interest in computer science and I know that it is not only based around 
						computers. Programming is a language that allows us to communicate with all types of technology. 
						Simply turning on a cell phone requires a bit of code. Everything works as a stimulus and a 
						response and programming is the bridge that connects them. Understanding how things respond and 
						communicate with one another is an experience on its own. Initiating a response is a gift that should 
						not be taken for granted. I plan to use programming to create the software of the future.
